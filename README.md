# BudgetBuddy

Tool for personal use to automate my finances, learning Python standards and focused on Excel and csv data processing and treatment.

## General

The idea is to spend as little time as possible managing my expenses and income, as well as my savings, different bank accounts and products.
The project will grow as I diversify my positions.

## First Version

***Input***:

Always will receive at least one Excel file containing the monthly movements, with their descriptions and dates.
For now this will be the only thing to be filled manually by me.
The idea is to be able to download all the movements from the bank accounts and transform them to this excel together with the cash movements that I will always have to impute manually.
A dataset with this structure will be operated:
>
> - Date
> - Description
> - Amount
> - Type
> - Category
> - Subcategory
> - Payment Method

***Output***:

*Annual and Monthly Income and Expenses (20XX)*: This will be the Excel(s) generated splitting by year, and in each we will had a monthly and an annual reportting.
